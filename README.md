This is a small collection of immigration data from Arab regions, building on the tables in the appendices of Gregory Orfala's 2006 book, *The Arab Americans: A History*. It also includes more recent data from the Department of Homeland Security to cover the period from 1869 to 2019.

The `chart.ipybn` contains some Python code that creates simple charts showing trends and also has information on the data sources themselves.
